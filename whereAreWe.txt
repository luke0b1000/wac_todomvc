1. The steps
    https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/maze-stealer
    !Learn how to ignore large parts of a codebase and get a piece-by-piece understanding.
    Before you start
        Read the docs (if they exist).
        Run the code.
        Play with the app to see what the code is supposed to do.
        Think about how the code might be implemented.
        Get the code into an editor.
        The process
    Look at the file structure.
        Get a sense for the vocabulary.
        Keep a note of unfamiliar concepts that you'll need to research later.
        Do a quick read-through without diving into concepts from #3.
        Test one feature with the debugger.
        Document and add comments to confusing areas.
        Research items in #3 only if required.
        Repeat.
    Next level
        Replicate parts of the app by hand (in the console).
        Make small changes and see what happens.
        Add a new feature.
